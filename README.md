### About

This is a project I did for a course on neural networks. It's based on the 'Seefood' app from the HBO show Silicon Valley which identifies food as either 'hotdog' or 'not hotdog'. HBO created a real [iOS and Android app](https://www.seefoodtechnologies.com/nothotdog/) based on the show. Details of the app development process can be found [here](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3).

The code here is for my take on the idea, a Shiny app. I used Keras with Tensorflow to build a model using [data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/data). The model development files can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/neural-nets/tree/master/not-hotdog).

Note that if you want to rebuild this app yourself you will need to train a model and place it in the same directory as the app. The model I used is not saved in this repository because the file size is too big.
