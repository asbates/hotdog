Sometimes you just can't tell if your hot dog is the real deal.

Let those worries rest because now you can be certain of your hot dogs authenticity. 
No more sleepless nights questioning what you ate for dinner.
With the brand new AI powered 'Hotdog' app you can be confident that when you order a hot dog, you're getting a hot dog! 



### About

This is a project I did for a course on neural networks. It's based on the 'Seefood' app from the HBO show Silicon Valley which identifies food as either 'hotdog' or 'not hotdog'. HBO created a real [iOS and Android app](https://www.seefoodtechnologies.com/nothotdog/) based on the show. Details of the app development process can be found [here](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3).

The code here is for my take on the idea, a Shiny app. I used Keras with Tensorflow to build a model using [data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/data). The model development files can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/neural-nets/tree/master/not-hotdog).
